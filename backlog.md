# NoiseCanvas Backlog

## Completed Tasks

- TASK-1: Basic Sampler implementation with sample loading and playback
- TASK-2: Note playback system with semitone-based pitch shifting
- TASK-3: Configurable silence/gap between notes
- TASK-4: 4-channel pattern system (Amiga-style)
- TASK-5: Pattern repeat functionality (finite and infinite loops)
- TASK-6: Single Speaker + software mixing for 4 channels
- TASK-7: Sample length normalization for precise timing
- TASK-8: BPM-based timing system (replaced gap-based timing)
- TASK-9: Technical rhythm test - complex 16-beat drum pattern
- TASK-10: Simple melody + rhythm test (piano + drums together)
- TASK-11: MOD file loader and playback (see loader.js and README.md for details)
- TASK-12: S3M file loader and playback with correct pitch calculation (see s3m-loader.js)
- TASK-13: S3M volume handling improvements (see s3m-loader.js for details)

## In-Progress

(none)

## TODO (Suggestions)

- Tick-based timing system for proper effect support (Note Delay, Volume Slides, etc.)
- MOD/S3M effect support (portamento, vibrato, arpeggio, etc.)
- Real-time streaming engine (vs current offline rendering)
