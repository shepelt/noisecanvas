## Experiments & Discoveries

### Lesson 1: Basic Drum Patterns (2025-01-08)

Experimented with 8-beat drum patterns at 120 BPM. Combined kick, snare, and hi-hat samples.
Used smash sample for emphasis on first beat.

### Lesson 2: Lo-fi Hip-hop Structure (2025-01-08)

Built a complete song structure: **Intro → Verse → Chorus**

**Chord Progression**: Am - F - C - G (i - VI - III - VII in A minor)

**Sections created:**
- **Intro** (16 rows): Simple chord roots, establishes groove. Layers: drums + melody + bass
- **Verse** (16 rows): More melodic movement, added pad (strings) for depth
- **Chorus** (16 rows): Higher octave lead (DreamBells), doubled kick drums, simpler repetitive hook, smash cymbal for impact

**Discovery**: Each section needs distinct energy levels. Chorus must differentiate strongly from verse through:
- Higher register melodies
- More instrumental layers
- Simpler, catchier, repetitive patterns (hooks)
- More driving rhythm

**BPM**: 92 (lo-fi hip-hop tempo range)
